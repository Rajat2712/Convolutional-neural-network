# CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS:   

Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets or CNNs) are a category of neural networks that have proven very effective in areas such as image recognition and classification. ConvNets have been successful in identifying faces, objects and traffic signs apart from powering vision in robots and self driving cars. 
CNNs use a variation of multilayer perceptrons designed to require minimal preprocessing. They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks (SIANN), based on their shared-weights architecture and translation invariance characteristics. Convolutional networks were inspired by biological processes in which the connectivity pattern between neurons is inspired by the organization of the animal visual cortex. Individual cortical neurons respond to stimuli only in a restricted region of the visual filled known as the receptive field. The receptive fields of different neurons partially overlap such that they cover the entire visual field.CNNs use relatively little pre-processing compared to other image classification algorithms. This means that the network learns the filters that in traditional algorithms were hand-engineered. This independence from prior knowledge and human effort in feature design is a major advantage.

 # HOW CNN WORKS:    
 CNN make use of kernels to extract the features from images.
 kernels can be of any function used to capture the local dependencies in a image 
 They uses convolution, pooling ,classification and non-linearity.
